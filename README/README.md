# Sam Nottingham Portfolio

My portfolio is a mobile-responsive built with React, ReactStrap, JavaScript, and CSS. I provide a bit about me, my experience and ways to contact me. Hope you enjoy!

## Deployed

Deployed through GH Pages and can be found [Here](https://jnottin.github.io/new_portfolio/). The README.md is in its own folder because for some reason GH pages in its GH Actions wants to publish the README.md instead of the app.
